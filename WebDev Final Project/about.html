<h2>About</h2>
<p>Master Kim Il-Kwon's Taekwon-Do was first established in 1987 and<br> hopes to teach people from the ages of 11 to 25 the art of Taekwon-Do,<br> Master Il-Kwon came up with the idea after helping some tourists<br> from a mugging on a walk home one night. He had the idea of setting up<br> a class where he can teach his skills so that people wouldn't be as defenceless.

<p>This is our dojo in Dublin and by far our most popular, hover the mouse over the <br>image to see the a picture of our champion match last year!</p>
<p>The plugin I used is called jQuery zoom by Jack Moore and can be found <a class = "link" href="http://www.jacklmoore.com/zoom/">here</a><br> The plugin allows the website user to zoom into a picture by <br>hovering, dragging or clicking on the picture. I chose to use the grabbing function because it <br>looked nice with the grabbing icon and its can be annoying if the mouse automatically zooms <br>in if you hover over. The grab function gives the user a lot more contol. <br>I had to download two javascript files called jquery.zoom.js and jquery.zoom.min.js<br>The code I had to use included <span style = "color:blue;"><strong>$('#img').zoom({on:'grab'});</strong></span> I had run into a problem previously where <br>I had img, img1, img2, img3 all equate to the grab cursors but there was a bug so <br>I had to let them all equate individually.</p>
